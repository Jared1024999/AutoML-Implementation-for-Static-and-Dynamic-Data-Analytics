# AutoML-Implementation-for-Static-and-Dynamic-Data-Analytics

This code provides an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) implementation for static and dynamic data analytics problems. It provides a case study of IoT anomaly detection using more than 10 ML algorithms and optimization/AutoML methods (for automating and optimizing ML algorithms). 

This code is also the implementation of a review paper published in **Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence** (IF: 7.8):  
L. Yang and A. Shami, “[IoT Data Analytics in Dynamic Environments: From An Automated Machine Learning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08018.pdf),” *Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence*, vol. 116, pp. 1-33, 2022, doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2022.105366.  

This paper and code will help industrial users, data analysts, and researchers to better develop machine learning models using automation technology.
